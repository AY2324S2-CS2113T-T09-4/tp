### Overview of Components

This part of the guide provides a high-level overview of each package and its classes via a class or sequence diagrams. A brief description of each class is given as well.

PulsePilot follows an **Object-Oriented Design** approach, with separate packages for handling different components of the application, such as user input, output, workout logging, and health data management.

The **_Architecture Diagram_** is given below:

![Architecture Diagram](img/architecture_diagram.png)

The `seedu.pulsepilot` package contains the `Main` method, the entry point of the application. It is responsible for the initialising, processing of user input and termination of PulsePilot.

- `Ui`: The user interface of PulsePilot used for handling user input and printing messages. 
- `Storage`: Contains the data storage components for PulsePilot.
- `Health`: Stores health-related information.
- `Workouts`: Stores workout-related information.
- `Utility`: Contains utility functions, such as input parsing and validation.
- `PulsePilot`: The main entry point for the application.
- `Constants`: Contains all constants used in PulsePilot.

### UI Package

The `UI` package contains the `Handler` and `Output` classes, which are responsible for handling user input and printing of output fo the screen respectively.

#### Handler

The main entry point of the application is the `Handler` class, used to determine the command used. The user's input is then passed to the right handler method to carry out the action.

The sequence diagram below shows how the application is initialised and processes the user's input using the `Handler` class:

![Handler Sequence Diagram](img/sequence_diagrams/handler_sequence_diagram.png)

1. PulsePilot is started via `handler.initialiseBot()`, which checks whether the data file is present and its integrity if applicable. How this is done will be covered [here](#storage-of-data).

2. `handler.processInput()` is then used to get the user's input for commands.

3. When PulsePilot exits gracefully via the `exit` command, `terminateBot()` is called to write to the data and hash files.
    - If a user exits without calling terminateBot(), **data will be lost!** Likewise, this is covered [here](#storage-of-data).

The `Handler` class creates other classes when it is used as shown in this sequence diagram:

![Handler Class Creation](img/sequence_diagrams/handler_class_creation.png)

The creation of the above classes will be left out of other sequence diagrams to prevent cluttering the diagram. **It is assumed in other class diagrams for `Handler` that the classes have already been created.**

###### [Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

#### Output

The `Output` class is responsible for printing messages, prompts, errors and other information to the terminal for the user.

The class diagram for `Output` has been omitted, since a developer can read the code itself to gain a better understanding of its methods.

### Workouts Package

The `Workout` package is responsible for tracking run and gym workouts from the user.

#### Workouts List

`WorkoutLists` is a class that contains the `ArrayList` objects of `Run`, `Gym` and `Workout`. The class diagram is as follows:

![WorkoutLists Class Diagram](img/class_diagrams/workoutlist_class_diagram.png)

The class contains methods to retrieve the different objects. Additionally, it contains the methods for **deleting** an object from PulsePilot, which is used for the `delete` command implementation.

The `clearWorkoutsRunGym()` method is used to clear all the data stored within each `ArrayList`, which is mainly used for unit testing.

#### Gym

`Gym` is a class that represents a gym session that the user has recorded. It contains the following attributes:

- `date`: An **optional** `LocalDate` attribute representing the date of the workout. Implemented via an overloaded `Gym()` constructor.

**A `Gym` object contains 1 or more `GymStation` objects.**

The class diagram for gym is as follows:

##### Gym Station

`GymStation` is a class that represents one gym station the user has done in a particular gym session. It contains the following attributes:

- `stationName`: Name of the gym station as a `String`.
-  `ArrayList<GymSet>`: An `ArrayList` of `GymSet` object, representing the varying number of sets done at one station.
- `numberOfSets`: The number of sets done as an `int`.

**A `GymStation` object contains 1 or more `GymSet` objects.**

###### [Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

`Run` is a class that represents a run workout the user has recorded. It contains the following attributes:

- `times`: An `Integer[]` variable representing the hours, minutes and seconds taken for a run.
- `distance`: The distance run in **kilometers** represented as a `double`.
- `date`: An **optional** `LocalDate` parameter representing the date of the workout. Implemented via an overloaded `Run()` constructor.
- `pace`: The pace of the run in minutes/km represented as a `String`.
- `isHourPresent`: A `boolean` variable to indicate if an hour has been indicated, since PulsePilot accepts both `HH:MM:SS` and `MM:SS` formats.

### Health Package

The `Health` package is responsible for tracking user's BMI, period cycle, and medical appointments.

---

#### Health List

`HealthList` is a class that contains the `ArrayList` objects of `Bmi`, `Period`, and `Appointment`. The class diagram is as follows:

![HealthList Class Diagram](img/class_diagrams/healthlist_class_diagram.png)

The class contains methods to retrieve the different objects. Additionally, it contains the methods for:

- **Deleting** an object from PulsePilot, which is used for the `delete` command implementation.
- Showing the **latest** object added to PulsePilot, which is used for the `latest` command implementation.
- Showing the **history or list** of objects added to bot, which is used for the `history` command implementation.

The `clearHealthLists()` method is used to clear all the data stored within each `ArrayList`, which is mainly used for unit testing.

###### [Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

### Utility Package

The `Utility` package includes classes and methods that handle exceptions, user input parsing, user input validation, and the various filter strings using enumerations.

It consists of `CustomExceptions`, `Filters`, `Parser` and `Validation` classes, which are covered below.

###### [Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

---

#### Parser

The `Parser` class is responsible for splitting the user's input into lists of parameters.

The input **must contain the flags required for each command**, else an exception will be thrown. The number of `/` characters is checked as well, as it can trigger errors. Afterwards, the split input is validated using methods within the `Validated` class as `String[]` variables.

###### [Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

---

#### Validation

The `Validation` class is responsible for validating the user's split input. The split input comes from the `Parser` class in `String[]` variables.

Each variable is then checked to ensure that it follows the format needed. This is done by ensuring there are no empty strings, whether it matches regex, etc. If not, the methods in this class throws exceptions.

###### [Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

---

#### Custom Exceptions

The `CustomExceptions` class inherits from the `Exception` class from Java. This class is in charge of printing formatted errors.

The exceptions are further broken down into the following:

- `OutOfBounds`: When an access with an illegal index is made.
- `InvalidInput`: When user enters input that does not conform with required format or is malformed.
- `FileReadError`: Unable to read the files for `Storage`.
- `FileWriteError`: Unable to write files for `Storage`.
- `FileCreateError`: Unable to create files for `Storage`.
- `InsufficientInput`: When not enough parameters or blank parameters for a command are detected.

###### [Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

---

#### Filters

The `Filters` class contains all the filter strings for different use cases, such as when adding a workout or viewing the history.

This is represented as enumerations. Attempts to use an invalid filter results in `IllegalArgumentException` being thrown.

###### [Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

<!-- @@author L5-Z -->

### Storage Package

`Storage` contains `DataFile` and `LogFile`. This component handles all logging of commands used and writing of data stored within PulsePilot to an external data file. The reading of the data file is also done here, allowing PulsePilot to resume a previous saved state.

- `DataFile` is responsible for the writing of data to `pulsepilot_data.txt`, and generating the hash for it in `pulsepilot_hash.txt`. It also checks whether the data has been tampered with or files are missing, and creates or deletes files if needed.

- `LogFile` writes the logs to `pulsepilot_log.txt`, tracking each command and error thrown.

###### [Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

---

### Constants Package

This package contains all of the different constants used throughout PulsePilot to prevent the usage of magic strings and numbers.

The constants are broken down into the following 4 classes:

- `HealthConstant`: All constant strings and numbers related to all `Health` commands and methods.
- `WorkoutConstant`: All constant strings and numbers related to all `Workout` commands and methods.
- `ErrorConstant`: All strings used when exceptions are thrown.
- `UiConstant`: All other constants and numbers that are not within the above three classes, such as file names, flags, and other general purpose constants.

    * [Add Run](#add-run)
    * [Add Gym](#add-gym)
* [Health](#health)
    * [Add BMI](#add-bmi)
    * [Add Period](#add-period)

* [View Latest](#view-latest)
* [Delete Item](#delete-item)
* [Storage of Data](#storage-of-data)

### Workout

User input is passed to `Handler.processInput()`, which determines the command used is `workout`. The input is then passed to `Handler.handleWorkout()` as shown in the `Handler` architecture above. Either a `Run` or `Gym` object is then added.

#### Add Run

The user's input is processed to add a run as follows:

1. `handler.handleWorkout()` determines the type of workout to add is `run`, and calls the `parser.parseRunInput()` method to process the user's run input.

2. `parser.parseRunInput()` splits the input using `parser.splitRunInput()` using the flags, returning a `String[]` variable.
    - Method also extracts the optional `date` parameter if present.

3. `validation.validateRunInput()` is called to validate each parameter. If no exceptions caused by invalid parameters are thrown, the validated parameters are used to create the new `Run` object.

4. The `Run` constructor checks whether the distance given and pace calculated is within the valid range. If not, it throws an exception.

5. Afterwards, the `Workout` constructor is implicitly called since `Run` inherits from `Workout`. `workout.addIntoWorkoutList()` is called, which calls `workoutLists.addRun()` to add the `Run`.  

5. The new `Run` object is then passed to `output.printAddRun()` and a message acknowledging the successful adding is printed to the screen.

An overloaded `Run` and `Workout` constructor is used to allow for `date` to be optional. 

This is the sequence diagram for adding a run:

#### Add Gym

The user's input is processed to add a gym is as follows:

1. `handler.handleWorkout()` determines the type of workout which is `gym`, and calls the `parser.parseGymInput()` method to process the user's gym input.

2. `parser.parseGymInput()` splits the input using `parser.splitGymInput()` using the flags, returning a `String[]` variable.
    - Method also extracts the optional `date` parameter if present.

3. `validation.validateGymInput()` is called to validate each parameter. If no exceptions caused by invalid parameters are thrown, the validated parameters are used to create the new `Gym` object.

4. The `Gym` constructor adds the newly created object into `workoutList.WORKOUTS` and `workoutList.GYMS` via `addWorkout()` and `addGym()`.  

5. Afterwards, `parseGymStationInput()` is called to retrieve input for each gym station.

This is the sequence diagram for adding a `Gym` thus far:

![Gym Sequence Diagram](img/sequence_diagrams/gym_overall_sequence_diagram.png)

##### Add Gym Station

After adding a `Gym` object, the user is then prompted for input for the gym station. The gym station input is processed as follows:

1. `parser.parseGymStationInput()` is called, which starts a loop that iterates `NUMBER_OF_STATION` times, adding a `GymStation` object each time.

2. `output.printGymStationPrompt()` is used to print the prompt for the user, and user input is retrieved.

3. User input is passed to `validation.splitAndValidateGymStationInput()`, which as the name suggests, splits and validates the parameters from the user, returning a `String[]` variable.

4. After splitting the input, the weights parameter is validated via `validation.validateWeightsArray()`, returning a `ArrayList<Double>` variable containing the valid weights.

5. After all parameters are validated, it is passed to `newGym.addStation()` to add a `GymStation` object to the existing `Gym` object. The `GymStation` object is appended to an `ArrayList<GymStation>` variable.

6. Steps 2 to 5 repeat until all stations have been added.

7. The final `Gym` object is passed to `output.printAddGym()` and a message acknowledging the successful adding is printed to the screen.

This is the sequence diagram for adding a `GymStation` object:

![Gym Station Sequence](img/sequence_diagrams/gym_station_sequence_diagram.png)

### Health

User input is passed to `handler.processInput()`, which determines the command used is `health`. The input is then passed to `handler.handleHealth()` as shown in the Handler architecture above. Either `Bmi`, `Period` or `Appointment` object is added, or a menstrual cycle prediction is made.

---

#### Add BMI

The user's input is processed to add a `Bmi` as follows:

1. `handler.handleHealth()` determines the type of health to add is `Bmi`, and calls the `parser.parseBmiInput()` method to process the user's BMI input.

2. `parser.parseBmiInput()` splits the input using `parser.splitBmiInput()` using the flags, returning a `String[]` variable.

3. `validation.validateBmiInput()` is called to validate each parameter. If no exceptions caused by invalid parameters are thrown, the validated parameters are used to create the new `Bmi` object.

4. The `Bmi` constructor adds the newly created object into `HealthList.BMIS` via `healthlist.addBMI()`. The BMI value and BMI category is determined from `Bmi.calculateBmiValue()` and `Bmi.getBmiCategory()` methods respectively and stored.

5. The `Bmi` object is passed to `Output.printAddBmi()` and a message acknowledging the successful adding is printed to the screen.

This is the sequence diagram for adding a BMI entry:

![Bmi Sequence Diagram](img/sequence_diagrams/bmi_sequence.png)

###### [Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

#### Add Period

The user's input is processed to add a `Period` as follows:

1. `handler.handleHealth()` determines the type of health add is `Period`, and calls the `parser.parsePeriodInput()` method to process the user's period input.

2. `parser.parsePeriodInput()` splits the input using `parser.splitPeriodInput()` using the flags, returning a `String[]` variable.
    - Method also extracts the optional end date parameter if present.

3. `validation.validatePeriodInput()` is called to validate each parameter. If no exceptions caused by invalid parameters are thrown, the validated parameters are used to create the new `Period` object.

4. If end date is absent, the `Period` constructor adds the newly created object into `healthlist.PERIODS`. Else, the static `HealthList.getPeriod()` method is called to retrieve the latest period input and update end date using `period.updateEndDate()` method.
   - If the size of `HealthList.PERIODS` is greater than `1`, `HealthList.PERIODS` will be iterated through to set cycle length using `period.setCycleLength()` method.


5. The `Period` object is passed to `output.printAddPeriod()` and a message acknowledging the successful adding is printed to the screen.

This is the sequence diagram for adding a period from `parser.parsePeriodInput()`:

![Period Sequence Diagram](img/sequence_diagrams/period_sequence.png)

![Set Cycle Length Diagram](img/sequence_diagrams/set_Cycle_Length.png)

##### Make Period Prediction

The user's input is processed to make a period prediction if there are **at least 4 `Period` objects recorded** as follows:

1. `handler.handleHealth()` determines the type of health which is `prediction`, and calls the `parser.parsePredictionInput()` method to process the user's prediction input.

2. If the size of `PeriodList` is larger or equals to 4, `printLatestThreeCycles()` is called to print the latest three cycles. Else, an exception is thrown.

3. `period.predictNextPeriodStartDate()` calls `period.nextCyclePrediction()` which further calls `period.getLastThreeCycleLengths()` to calculate the `sumOfCycleLengths` of latest three cycles. `sumOfCycleLengths` divided by `3` to find the average cycle length.

4. The static `Period.printNextCyclePrediction()` method prints the predicted start date to the screen.

#### Add Appointment

The user's input is processed to add an Appointment  as follows:

1. `handler.handleHealth()` determines the type of health which is appointment, and calls the `parser.parseAppointmentInput()` method to process the user's appointment input.

2. `parser.parseAppointmentInput()` splits the input using `parser.splitAppointmentDetails()` using the flags, returning a `String[]` variable.

3. `validation.validateAppointmentDetails()` is called to validate each parameter. If no exceptions caused by invalid parameters are thrown, the validated parameters are used to create the new `Appointment` object.

4. The `Appointment` constructor adds the newly created object into `HealthList.APPOINTMENTS` via `healthlist.addAppointment()`.

5. The new `Appointment` object is passed to `Output.printAddAppointment()` and a message acknowledging the successful adding is printed to the screen.

This is the sequence diagram for adding an Appointment from `parseAppointmentInput()`:

### View History

1. User input is passed to `handler.processInput()`, which determines the command used is `history`, thus passing the user's input to `handler.handleHistory()`.

2. `handler.handleHistory()` uses `parser.parseHistory()` method to extract and validate the filter string entered via the `item` flag.
    - If the user input is valid, it will return the `filter` string.
    - Else, returns `null`.

3. `handler.handleHistory()` will then call `output.printHistory(filter)` which uses the `filter` string to determine which method to use, as shown below:

    - `workouts`: `output.printWorkoutHistory()`
    - `run`: `output.printRunHistory()`
    - `gym`: `output.printGymHistory()`
    - `bmi`: `output.printBmiHistory()`
    - `period`: `output.printPeriodHistory()`
    - `appointment`: `output.printAppointmentHistory()`

This is the sequence diagram for `history`:

### View Latest

1. User input is passed to `handler.processInput()`, which determines the command used is `latest`, thus passing the user's input to `handler.handleLatest()`.

2. `handler.handleLatest()` uses `parser.parseLatest()` method to extract and validate the filter string entered via the `item` flag.
    - If the user input is valid, it will return the `filter` string.
    - Else, returns `null`.

3. `handler.handleHistory()` will then call `output.printLatest(filter)` which uses the `filter` string to determine which method to use, as shown below:

    - `run`: `output.printLatestRun()`
    - `gym`: `output.printLatestGym()`
    - `bmi`: `output.printLatestBmi()`
    - `period`: `output.printLatestPeriod()`
    - `appointment`: `output.printLatestAppointment()`

### Delete Item

Deleting an item follows this sequence:

1. User input is passed to `handler.processInput()`, determining that the command used is `delete`, thus passing the user's input to `handler.handleDelete()`.

2. User input is passed to `parser.parseDeleteInput()`, and the input is split by `Parser.splitDeleteInput()` using the flags, returning a `String[] deleteDetails` variable containing the `filter` string and `index` integer for the item to delete.

3. Split `deleteDetails` are passed to `validation.validateDeleteInput()`. If no exceptions caused by invalid parameters are thrown, `String[] validDeleteDetails` is returned.

4. `validDeleteDetails` is passed back to `Handler`, which calls the respective `deleteItem()` method from either `HealthList` or `WorkoutList` depending on the details passed. 

    - `run`: `WorkoutList.deleteRun()`
    - `gym`: `WorkoutList.deleteGym()`
    - `bmi`: `HealthList.deleteBmi()`
    - `period`: `healthList.deletePeriod()`
    - `appointment`: `healthlist.deleteAppointment()`

### Storage of Data

The storage is split into `DataFile` for the reading and saving of user data, and `LogFile` for writing logs. `DataFile` is covered here, since the storing and reading of user data is more important to a developer.

#### Saving Data

Saving of data happens only when the `exit` command is used:

1. Upon `exit`, `handler.terminateBot()` is called, which calls `dataFile.saveDataFile()`.

2. The name of the user, health data and workout data are written to `pulsepilot_data.txt` via `dataFile.writeName()`, `dataFile.writeHealthData()` and `dataFile.writeWorkoutData()`.

3. To prevent tampering of the file, the SHA-256 hash of the data file is calculated via `dataFile.generateFileHash()` and written to `pulsepilot_hash.txt` via `writeHashToFile()`.

![Storage Sequence](img/sequence_diagrams/storage_sequence.png)

#### Reading Data

The reading of files has been implemented as follows:

1. The file hash from `pulsepilot_hash.txt` is read, and the SHA-256 hash of `pulsepilot_data.txt` is calculated.
    - If the hashes do not match, the files have been tampered with. The data and hash file are deleted (if present), and PulsePilot exits.

2. The first line is read and split to get the user's name.

3. Subsequent lines contain the health and workout data stored, which is split and added to `HealthList` and `WorkoutList` respectively.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Usability**: The application should have a user-friendly command-line interface with clear instructions and prompts for user input.
- **Reliability**: The application should handle invalid or incomplete user input gracefully, providing appropriate error messages and prompting the user for correct input.
- **Maintainability**: The codebase should follow best practices for Object-Oriented Programming, including proper separation of concerns, modularization, and code documentation.
- **Testability**: The application should have comprehensive unit tests and integration tests to ensure correct functionality.
- **Data Integrity**: The application checks whether the data file has been tampered with, and deletes or creates files as needed.

| Flags    | The strings used by PulsePilot to differentiate parameters. For example, `/date:` is the date flag, used to specify the date for a given command. |
| UI  | The User Interface (UI), which is the point of contact between users and our application. This component handles the user input, and prints messages or errors.                                                  |
| Storage | Responsible for saving data, and reading the data file to resume a previous save state. For our application, this also involves checking the integrity of the file and throwing errors if needed.                                                                     |
| Lock File | A `.lck` file, created to prevent multiple processes or users from accessing a file.                                                                      |

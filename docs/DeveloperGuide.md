## Introduction

The aim of this guide is to provide an explanation for all the functions and processing of information in PulsePilot. This is to enable any technical readers to get a detailed understanding of the application's internals.

The application follows an Object-Oriented Design approach, with separate classes for handling different components
of the application, such as user input, output, exercise logging, and health data management.
The main entry point of the application is the Handler class, which contains the processInput method. 
This method is responsible for parsing user input, validating it, and delegating the appropriate actions 
to other classes based on the command provided.

The Output class is responsible for printing messages, prompts, and information to the console.

The Run and Gym classes represent different types of exercises that the user can log. 
The Health, Bmi, Period and Appointment classes are used to manage health-related data, such as Body Mass Index (BMI), 
menstrual period information and medical appointment details. 

The LogFile class is used for logging application events and user actions to a log file.

{Describe the design and implementation of the product. Use UML diagrams and short code snippets where applicable.}

This guide will include UML diagrams to better each component of our product.

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the PulsePilot.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

`Main`

- When PulsePilot is launched, it creates an instance of `PulsePilot`.

`PulsePilot`
- Upon creation, it initialises a `LogFile` and `DataFile` object to create log and data files for the bot.
- The `initialiseBot()` function is called to retrieve the user's name.

The bulk of the appâ€™s work is done by the following five components:

* `UI`: The UI of the PulsePilot which handles interactions with the user.
* `Utility`: Parses the inputs and commands from the user.
* `Health`: Contains the methods for health-related functionalities (i.e. appointment, bmi, and period), such as adders,
getters, and managing lists of health objects.
* `Workout`: Contains the methods for workout-related functionalities (i.e. gym and run), such as adders, getters, and 
managing lists of workout objects.
* `Storage`: Reads data from, and writes data to, the output file.

`Constants` represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components

_{Insert Class Diagram}_

1. `Health` class stores date. 
2. `HealthList`class stores separate lists for different `Health` objects using ArrayList.
`HealthList`includes methods to add, delete, view history of the various `Health`lists.
3. `Bmi`class stores bmi attributes (i.e. height, weight, date, bmi value and bmi category). 
4. `Period`class stores period attributes (i.e. start date of period, end date of period, period length 
and cycle length). 
5. `Appointment`class stores appointment attributes (i.e. date, time, appointment description). Primarily, `Appointment`
has all necessary getter methods to access the attributes.

## Appendices

### Appendix A: Product scope

#### Target user profile

Outpatients who need to monitor their health activity and health parameters.

#### Value proposition

PulsePilot is a health monitoring application designed to bridge the gap between medical professionals 
and patients during outpatient recovery. PulsePilot offers outpatients the capability to input and track a range of 
health activities, encompassing both aerobic and anaerobic exercises, alongside crucial health parameters such as 
BMI and menstrual cycles. Simultaneously, PulsePilot facilitates access to this vital data for various 
healthcare professionals, ensuring comprehensive and seamless support in guiding outpatient recovery processes.

### Appendix E: Instructions for manual testing

{Give instructions on how to do a manual product testing e.g., how to load sample data to be used for testing}

[Return to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

#### Adding a new run

#### Expected Input: 
```java
WORKOUT /e:run /d:<distance> /t:<time> /date:<date>
```
- Replace `<distance>` with the distance covered to 2 decimal place  (e.g. if the distance is 5.123 km, enter 5.12).
- Replace `<time>` with the duration of the run in the format `HH:MM:SS` (e.g. if you ran for an hour and 5 minutes,
  enter 01:05:00).
- Replace `<date>` with the date of the run in the format `DD-MM-YYYY` (e.g. if the date is 24/07/2024, enter
  24-07-2024).

#### Sequence Diagram for Adding a New Run Exercise
wip
<!--![Sequence Diagram for Adding a New Run Exercise]()-->

#### General Workflow of Adding a New Run Exercise
1. User input is passed to `handleExercise()` of the `handler` class.
2. `handleExercise()` will call `checkTypeOfExercise()` to validate the input and determine the type of exercise.
3. If the exercise type is `run`, `checkTypeofExercise()` will return `WorkoutConstant.RUN`
4. Upon receiving `WorkoutConstant.RUN`, `handlerExercise()` will call `Run.getRun()` to extract out
all the run details. These details are stored in `runDetails: String[]`.
5. `handlerExercise()` will then call `Run.addRun` to create a `newRun` object
   - If there is a date provided, it will add the date to the `newRun` object.
   - Else it will add `NA` to the date parameter. 
   - It will also add the `distance`, `time`, and `pace` to the `newRun` object.
   - Lastly, it will add the `newRun` object to the `runList` and `workoutList` in the `WorkoutList` class.
6. The newly created `newRun` object is parsed into `Output.printAddRun()` and printed out to the user

#### How to load sample data
The application does not currently support loading sample data. However, you can manually test different scenarios 
by entering commands and providing input through the command-line interface.

For example, to test logging a run exercise, you can enter the following command:
```java
WORKOUT /e:run /d:10.3 /t:00:40:10 /date:15-03-2024
```

This command will create a new run exercise with a distance of 10.3 units, a duration of 40 minutes and 10 seconds,
and a date of March 15, 2024.

Similarly, you can test logging gym workouts, recording BMI and menstrual period information, tracking medical
appointment, viewing the exercise history, and accessing the latest run details by entering the appropriate commands.

### Overview of Components

This part of the guide provides a high-level overview of each package and its classes via a class or sequence diagram. A brief description of each class is given as well.

PulsePilot follows an **Object-Oriented Design** approach, with separate packages for handling different components of the application, such as user input, output, workout logging, and health data management.

The **_Architecture Diagram_** is given below:

![Architecture Diagram](img/architecture_diagram.png)

The `seedu.pulsepilot` package contains the `Main` method, which is the entry point of the application. It is responsible for initialising and processing of user input, and the termination of PulsePilot.

- `Ui`: The user interface of PulsePilot used for handling user input and printing messages.
- `Storage`: Contains the data storage and logging components for PulsePilot.
- `Health`: Stores health-related information.
- `Workouts`: Stores workout-related information.
- `Utility`: Contains utility functions, such as input parsing and validation.
- `Constants`: Contains all constants used in PulsePilot.

### UI Package

The `UI` package contains the `Handler` and `Output` classes, which are responsible for handling user input and printing of output to the screen respectively.

#### Handler

The main entry point of the application is the `Handler` class. The user's input is read here and passed to the corresponding handler method.

The sequence diagram below shows how it works:

![Handler Sequence Diagram](img/sequence_diagrams/handler_sequence_diagram.png)

1. PulsePilot is started via `handler.initialiseBot()`, which checks whether the data file is present and its integrity if applicable. How this is done will be covered [here](#storage-of-data).

2. `handler.processInput()` is then used to get the user's input, determining what command being used and passes the input to the right `handler` method.

3. When PulsePilot exits gracefully via the `exit` command, `terminateBot()` is called to write to the data and hash files.
    - If a user exits without calling terminateBot(), **data will be lost!** Likewise, this is covered [here](#storage-of-data).

The `Handler` class creates other classes:

- `Scanner` as `in` to read user input.
- `Validation` as `validation` for validating user input.
- `Parser` as `parser` for parsing user input.
- Static `LogFile` as `logFile` to write logs.
- `DataFile` as `dataFile` to write data stored.
- `Output` as `output` to print messages to the user.

The creation of the above classes will be left out of other sequence diagrams to prevent cluttering the diagram. **It is assumed in other class diagrams for `Handler` that the classes have already been created.**

#### Output

The `Output` class is responsible for printing messages, prompts, errors and other information to the terminal for the user.

The class diagram for `Output` has been omitted, since a developer can read the code itself to gain a better understanding of its methods.

### Workouts Package

The `Workout` package is responsible for tracking run and gym workouts from the user.

#### Workouts List

`WorkoutLists` is a class that contains the `ArrayList` objects of `Run`, `Gym` and `Workout`. The class diagram is as follows:

![WorkoutLists Class Diagram](img/class_diagrams/workoutlist_class_diagram.png)

The class contains methods to retrieve all or the latest added object, and delete objects.

The `clearWorkoutsRunGym()` method is used to clear all the data stored within each `ArrayList`, which is mainly used for unit testing.

#### Gym

`Gym` is a class that represents a gym session that the user has recorded. It contains the following attributes:

- `date`: An **optional** `LocalDate` attribute representing the date of the workout. Implemented via an overloaded `Gym()` constructor.

**A `Gym` object contains 0 or more `GymStation` objects.** A `Gym` with 0 `GymStation` objects can exist through using `workout /e:gym` and then `back`, but is deleted right after.

### Utility Package

The `Utility` package includes classes and methods that handle exceptions, user input parsing, user input validation, and the various filter strings using enumerations.

It consists of `CustomExceptions`, `Filters`, `Parser` and `Validation` classes, which are covered below.

###### [Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

---

#### Parser

The `Parser` class is responsible for splitting the user's input into lists of parameters.

The input **must contain the flags required for each command**, else an exception will be thrown. The number of `/` characters is checked as well, as it can trigger errors. Afterwards, the split input is validated using methods within the `Validated` class as `String[]` variables.

###### [Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

---

#### Validation

The `Validation` class is responsible for validating the user's split input. The split input comes from the `Parser` class in `String[]` variables.

Each variable is then checked to ensure that it follows the format needed. This is done by ensuring there are no empty strings, whether it matches regex, etc. If not, the methods in this class throws exceptions.

###### [Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

---

#### Custom Exceptions

The `CustomExceptions` class inherits from the `Exception` class from Java. This class is responsible for printing formatted errors.

The exceptions are further broken down into the following:

- `OutOfBounds`: When access with an illegal index is made.
- `InvalidInput`: When user enters input that does not conform with required format or is malformed.
- `FileReadError`: Unable to read the files for `Storage`.
- `FileWriteError`: Unable to write files for `Storage`.
- `FileCreateError`: Unable to create files for `Storage`.
- `InsufficientInput`: When not enough parameters or blank parameters for a command are detected.

###### [Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

---

#### Filters

The `Filters` class contains all the filter strings for different use cases, such as when adding a workout or viewing the history.

This is represented as enumerations. Attempts to use an invalid filter results in `IllegalArgumentException` being thrown.

###### [Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

<!-- @@author L5-Z -->

### Storage Package

`Storage` package contains `DataFile` and `LogFile`. This component handles all logging of commands used and writing of data stored within PulsePilot to an external data file. The reading of the data file is also done here, allowing PulsePilot to resume a previous saved state.

- `DataFile` is responsible for the writing of data to `pulsepilot_data.txt`, and generating the hash for it in `pulsepilot_hash.txt`. It also checks whether the data has been tampered with or files are missing, and creates or deletes files if needed.

- `LogFile` writes the logs to `pulsepilot_log.txt`, tracking each command and error thrown.

This package also checks whether the application has read and write permissions over its current directory. If not, it throws an exception and exits.

###### [Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

---

### Constants Package

This package contains all the different constants used throughout PulsePilot to prevent the usage of magic strings and numbers.

The constants are broken down into the following 4 classes:

- `HealthConstant`: All constant strings and numbers related to all `Health` commands and methods.
- `WorkoutConstant`: All constant strings and numbers related to all `Workout` commands and methods.
- `ErrorConstant`: All strings used when exceptions are thrown.
- `UiConstant`: All other constants and numbers that are not within the above three classes, such as file names, flags, and other general purpose constants.

## Implementation of Commands

**NOTE**: Not every single line of code is explained here, as any developer can read the source code to find out all the specifics.

* [Workout](#workout)
    * [Add Run](#add-run)
    * [Add Gym](#add-gym)
* [Health](#health)
    * [Add BMI](#add-bmi)
    * [Add Period](#add-period)
        * [Make Period Prediction](#make-period-prediction)
    * [Add Appointment](#add-appointment)
* [View History](#view-history)
* [View Latest](#view-latest)
* [Delete Item](#delete-item)
* [Storage of Data](#storage-of-data)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Workout

User input is passed to `handler.processInput()`, determining the command used is `workout`. Then, `Handler.handleHealth()` determines type of `workout` command used.

#### Add Run

The user's input is processed to add a run as follows:

1. `parser.parseRunInput()` splits the input using `parser.splitRunInput()` using the flags, returning a `String[]` variable. Extracts the optional `date` parameter if present.

2. `validation.validateRunInput()` is called to validate each parameter. If no exceptions caused by invalid parameters are thrown, the validated parameters are used to create the new `Run` object.

3. The `Run` constructor checks whether the distance given and pace calculated is within the valid range. If not, it throws an exception.

4. Afterwards, a `Workout` object is implicitly created since `Run` inherits from `Workout`. `workout.addIntoWorkoutList()` is called, creating a new `WorkoutLists` object, and `workoutLists.addRun()` is used to add the `Run`.  

5. The new `Run` object is then passed to `output.printAddRun()` and a message acknowledging the successful adding is printed to the screen.

This is the sequence diagram for adding a run:

![Run Sequence Diagram](img/sequence_diagrams/run_sequence_diagram.png)

#### Add Gym

The user's input is processed to add a gym is as follows:

1. `parser.parseGymInput()` splits the input using `parser.splitGymInput()` using the flags, returning a `String[]` variable. Extracts the optional `date` parameter if present.

2. `validation.validateGymInput()` is called to validate each parameter. If no exceptions caused by invalid parameters are thrown, the validated parameters are used to create the new `Gym` object.

3. Afterwards, a `Workout` object is implicitly created since `Gym` inherits from `Workout`. `workout.addIntoWorkoutList()` is called, creating a new `WorkoutLists` object, and `workoutLists.addGym()` is used to add the `Gym`.

4. Afterwards, `parser.parseGymStationInput()` is called to retrieve input for each gym station.

This is the sequence diagram for adding a `Gym` thus far:

![Gym Sequence Diagram](img/sequence_diagrams/gym_overall_sequence_diagram.png)

##### Add Gym Station

After adding a `Gym` object, the user is then prompted for input for the gym station. The gym station input is processed as follows:

1. `parser.parseGymStationInput()` is called, which starts a loop that iterates `NUMBER_OF_STATION` times.

2. `output.printGymStationPrompt()` is used to print the prompt for the user, and user input is retrieved.

3. User input is split using `Parser.splitGymStationInput()` which as the name suggests, splits the parameters from the user, returning a `String[]` variable.

4. After splitting the input, the parameters are passed to `newGym.addStation()`.

5. `newGym.addStation()` will then create a `GymStation` object during which the input is checked within the `GymStation` class.

6. If the values are valid, the `GymStation` object is appended to an `ArrayList<GymStation>` stored in the `newGym` object.

7. Steps 2 to 6 repeats until all stations have been added.

8. The final `Gym` object is passed to `output.printAddGym()` and a message acknowledging the successful adding is printed to the screen.

This is the sequence diagram for adding a `GymStation` object:

![Gym Station Sequence](img/sequence_diagrams/gym_station_sequence_diagram.png)

If the user types `back` at any given point when taking in `GymStation` input, this method returns and the `Gym` object is deleted.

### Health

User input is passed to `handler.processInput()`, determining the command used is `health`. Then, `Handler.handleHealth()` determines type of `health` command used.

#### Add BMI

The user's input is processed to add a `Bmi` as follows:

1. `parser.parseBmiInput()` splits the user's input string using `parser.splitBmiInput()` using the flags, returning a `String[]` variable.

2. `validation.validateBmiInput()` is called to validate each parameter. If no exceptions caused by invalid parameters are thrown, the validated parameters are used to create the new `Bmi` object.

3. The `Bmi` constructor creates a `HealthList` object, and adds the newly created object into `HealthList.BMIS` via `healthlist.addBmi()`. The BMI value and BMI category are determined from `Bmi.calculateBmiValue()` methods , and only the BMI Value is stored.

4. The `Bmi` object is passed to `Output.printAddBmi()` and a message acknowledging the successful adding is printed to the screen.

This is the sequence diagram for adding a BMI entry:

![Bmi Sequence Diagram](img/sequence_diagrams/bmi_sequence.png)

###### [Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

#### Add Period

The user's input is processed to add a `Period` as follows:

1. `parser.parsePeriodInput()` splits the input using `parser.splitPeriodInput()` using the flags, returning a `String[]` variable.
    - Method also extracts the optional end date parameter if present.

2. `validation.validatePeriodInput()` is called to validate each parameter. If no exceptions caused by invalid parameters are thrown, the validated parameters are used to create the new `Period` object.

3. The `Period` constructor adds the newly created object into `healthlist.PERIODS`.

4. The `Period` object is passed to `output.printAddPeriod()` and a message acknowledging the successful adding is printed to the screen.

Overloaded constructor is used to add the optional end date.

This is the sequence diagram for adding a period entry:

![Period Sequence Diagram](img/sequence_diagrams/period_sequence.png)

##### Make Period Prediction

The user's input is processed to make a period prediction if there are **at least 4 `Period` objects recorded** as follows:

1. The `parser.parsePredictionInput()` method to process the user's prediction input.

2. If the size of `PeriodList` is larger or equals to 4, `printLatestThreeCycles()` is called to print the latest three cycles. Else, an exception is thrown.

3. `period.predictNextPeriodStartDate()` calls `period.nextCyclePrediction()` which further calls `period.getLastThreeCycleLengths()` to calculate the `sumOfCycleLengths` of latest three cycles. The `sumOfCycleLengths` is divided by `3` to find the average cycle length.

4. The static `Period.printNextCyclePrediction()` method prints the predicted start date to the screen.

![Period Prediction Sequence Diagram](img/sequence_diagrams/prediction_sequence_diagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Add Appointment

The user's input is processed to add an Appointment  as follows:

1. `parser.parseAppointmentInput()` splits the input using `parser.splitAppointmentDetails()` using the flags, returning a `String[]` variable.

2. `validation.validateAppointmentDetails()` is called to validate each parameter. If no exceptions caused by invalid parameters are thrown, the validated parameters are used to create the new `Appointment` object.

3. The `Appointment` constructor creates a new `HealthList` object and adds the newly created object into `HealthList.APPOINTMENTS` via `healthlist.addAppointment()`.

4. The new `Appointment` object is passed to `Output.printAddAppointment()` and a message acknowledging the successful adding is printed to the screen.

This is the sequence diagram for adding an Appointment from `parseAppointmentInput()`:

### View History

1.  `parser.parseHistory()` is called to extract and validate the filter string entered via the `item` flag from user input.

2. `validation.validateHistoryFilter()` is called to check whether the filter string is valid. If not, it throws an exception.

3. `handler.handleHistory()` will then call `output.printHistory(filter)` which uses the `filter` string to determine which method to use, as shown below:

    - `workouts`: `output.printWorkoutHistory()`
    - `run`: `output.printRunHistory()`
    - `gym`: `output.printGymHistory()`
    - `bmi`: `output.printBmiHistory()`
    - `period`: `output.printPeriodHistory()`
    - `appointment`: `output.printAppointmentHistory()`

This is the sequence diagram for `history`:

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### View Latest

1.  `parser.parseLatest()` is called to extract and validate the filter string entered via the `item` flag from user input.

2. `validation.validateDeleteAndLatestFilter()` is called to check whether the filter string is valid. If not, it throws an exception. Both `delete` and `latest` have the same set of filters.

3. `handler.handleHistory()` will then call `output.printLatest(filter)` which uses the `filter` string to determine which method to use, as shown below:

    - `run`: `output.printLatestRun()`
    - `gym`: `output.printLatestGym()`
    - `bmi`: `output.printLatestBmi()`
    - `period`: `output.printLatestPeriod()`
    - `appointment`: `output.printLatestAppointment()`

### Delete Item

Deleting an item follows this sequence:

1. User input is passed to `parser.parseDeleteInput()`, and the input is split by `Parser.splitDeleteInput()` using the flags, returning a `String[] deleteDetails` variable containing the `filter` string and `index` integer for the item to delete.

2. Split `deleteDetails` are passed to `validation.validateDeleteInput()`. If no exceptions caused by invalid parameters are thrown, `String[] validDeleteDetails` is returned.

3. `validDeleteDetails` is passed back to `Handler`, which calls the respective `deleteItem()` method from either `HealthList` or `WorkoutList` depending on the details passed.

    - `run`: `WorkoutList.deleteRun()`
    - `gym`: `WorkoutList.deleteGym()`
    - `bmi`: `HealthList.deleteBmi()`
    - `period`: `HealthList.deletePeriod()`
    - `appointment`: `Healthlist.deleteAppointment()`

<!-- @@author L5-Z -->

### Storage of Data

The storage is split into `DataFile` for the reading and saving of user data, and `LogFile` for writing logs.

#### Saving Data

Saving of data happens only when the `exit` command is used:

1. Upon `exit` command being used, `handler.terminateBot()` is called, which calls `dataFile.saveDataFile()`.

2. The name of the user, health data and workout data are written to `pulsepilot_data.txt` via `dataFile.writeName()`, `dataFile.writeHealthData()` and `dataFile.writeWorkoutData()`.

3. To prevent tampering of the file, the SHA-256 hash of the data file is calculated via `dataFile.generateFileHash()` and written to `pulsepilot_hash.txt` via `writeHashToFile()`.

![Storage Sequence](img/sequence_diagrams/storage_sequence.png)

#### Reading Data

The reading of files has been implemented as follows:

1. The file hash from `pulsepilot_hash.txt` is read, and the SHA-256 hash of `pulsepilot_data.txt` is calculated.
    - If the hashes do not match, the files have been tampered with. The data and hash file are deleted (if present), and PulsePilot exits.
    - If one of the files is missing, PulsePilot attempts to delete both, and exits. User must run bot again to re-create both files.

2. The first line is read and split to get the user's name.

3. Subsequent lines contain the health and workout data stored, which is split and added to `HealthList` and `WorkoutList` respectively.

#### Log File

`pulsepilot_log.txt` is created when the bot starts if not present, and logs are added to it each time the user interacts with it. If the file is already present, PulsePilot appends to it.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Usability**: The application should have a user-friendly command-line interface with clear instructions and prompts for user input.
- **Reliability**: The application should handle invalid or incomplete user input gracefully, providing appropriate error messages and prompting the user for correct input.
- **Maintainability**: The codebase should follow best practices for Object-Oriented Programming, including proper separation of concerns, modularization, and code documentation.
- **Testability**: The application should have comprehensive unit tests and integration tests to ensure correct functionality.
- **Data Integrity**: The application checks whether the data file has been tampered with, and deletes or creates files as needed.

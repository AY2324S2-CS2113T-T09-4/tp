## Notes About Command Format

* Parameters in `UPPER_CASE` are to be **supplied by the user**.
* Parameters in square brackets are **optional**.
  * `[/date:DATE]` means that the `DATE` parameter is **optional**.
* If you are using a **PDF version of this document**, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
  * This can result in errors despite valid commands being used!

> ⚠️ PulsePilot commands are **not case-sensitive**. All commands are converted to upper case before being processed.

> ⚠️ The order of flags can be changed (for example, `/t: /d:` and `/d: /t:`) **unless mentioned otherwise**.

> ⚠️ Ensure that the syntax is **exactly the same** as provided in the user guide. Avoid using extra characters in the commands, such as blank space, newline, etc.

## Commands

### Workout: Run

Adds a new run session to track.

Format: <code style="color: #D85D43;">workout /e:run /d:DISTANCE /t:TIME [/date:DATE]</code>

* `DISTANCE` is a **2 decimal point positive number** (i.e. `15.24`) representing the distance ran in **kilometers**.
* `TIME` is in `[HH]:MM:SS` format (i.e. `25:30`). The `HH` representing hours is **optional**.
* `DATE` is in `DD-MM-YYYY` format (i.e. `19-03-2024`). The date is **optional**, and if not specified, defaults to `NA`.

> ⚠️ If `HH` is set to `00`, the bot will throw an error. Please use `MM:SS` if the `HH` field is not needed!

> ⚠️ Date specified cannot be later than the current date!

Examples:
- <code style="color: #D85D43;">workout /e:run /d:5.15 /t:25:03 /date:25-03-2023 </code>
- <code style="color: #D85D43;">workout /e:run /d:5.15 /t:25:03</code>

![Adding Runs](img/output/adding_runs.png)

> ⚠️ **Minimum and Maximum inputs:**
> Maximum Pace Value: 30:00/km, Minimum Pace Value: 1:00/km
> Maximum Run Time: 99:59:59, Minimum Run Time: 00:01
> Maximum Distance: 5000.00km, Minimum Distance: 0.01km
> 
> **Note that exceeding these bounds will trigger an error!**

### Workout: Gym

Adds a new gym session to track.

Format: <code style="color: #D85D43;">workout /e:gym /n:NUMBER_OF_STATIONS [/date:DATE]</code>

* `NUMBER_OF_STATIONS` is a **positive integer of at least 1** representing the number of stations for one Gym session.
* `DATE` is in `DD-MM-YYYY` format (i.e. `19-03-2024`). The date is **optional**, and if not specified, defaults to `NA`.

> ⚠️ Date specified cannot be later than the current date!

> ⚠️ Please input positive integers for `NUMBER_OF_STATIONS` without leading zeros. Entering a number with a leading zero, such as `01`, will trigger an error.

Examples: 
- <code style="color: #D85D43;">workout /e:gym /n:2 /date:25-03-2023</code>
- <code style="color: #D85D43;">workout /e:gym /n:4</code>

###### [Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

#### Adding Gym Stations

Upon entry of the <code style="color: #D85D43;">workout /e:gym</code> command, the bot will prompt for further details for each station done:

Format: <code style="color: #D85D43;">STATION_NAME /s:SET /r:REPS /w:WEIGHT</code>

* `STATION_NAME` is a **string**  representing the name of the gym station.
* `SET` is a **positive integer**  representing the number of sets done for one station.
* `REPS` is a **positive integer**  representing the number of repetitions done for one station.
* `WEIGHT` is a **list of positive numbers** separated by commas. It represents the weights used for all the sets in the station.

> ⚠️ `STATION_NAME` must always be the first parameter. The order of the other parameters can be in any order. `STATION_NAME` can **only contain letters and spaces**, and can be up to **40 characters long**.

> ⚠️ `WEIGHT` must be in **multiples of 0.125 KG**! This is because the minimum weight increment in a gym is 0.125kg. Example `bench press /s:2 /r:10 /w:10.333,12.5` is not valid as 10.333 is not a multiple of 0.125kg.

> ⚠️ Note that the **number of weights must equal to the number of sets**! For example, if you have done 2 sets at 10 kg, PulsePilot still expects 2 weights to be specified like this `squats /s:2 /r:5 /w:10.25,10.5`.

> ⚠️ Please input positive integers for `SETS` and `REPS` without leading zeros. Entering a number with a leading zero, such as `01`, will trigger an error.


Examples:
- <code style="color: #D85D43;">bench press /s:2 /r:4 /w:10,20</code>
- <code style="color: #D85D43;">squat /r:2 /s:2 /w:10.5,20.5</code>

Expected Output:

![Adding Gyms](img/output/adding_gym.png)

> ⚠️ **Minimum and Maximum inputs:**
> Minimum Weight: 0kg, Maximum Weight: 2850kg
> 
> 0kg is meant for **bodyweight exercises!**
> **Note that exceeding these bounds will trigger an error!**

### Health: BMI

Calculates user's Body Mass Index (BMI) based on height and weight from user's input, and tracks it.

Format: <code style="color: #D85D43;">health /h:bmi /height:HEIGHT /weight:WEIGHT /date:DATE</code>

* `HEIGHT` is a **2 decimal point number in metres** (i.e. `1.71`) representing the user's height.
* `WEIGHT` is a **2 decimal point number in kilograms** (i.e. `60.50`) representing the user’s weight.
* `DATE` is in `DD-MM-YYYY` format (i.e. `19-03-2024`).

> ⚠️ Date specified cannot be later than the current date!

Examples:
* <code style="color: #D85D43;">health /h:bmi /height:1.70 /weight:75.42 /date:19-03-2024</code>
* <code style="color: #D85D43;">health /h:bmi /date:19-03-2024 /height:1.70 /weight:75.42</code>

PulsePilot will categorize your BMI as follows:

- BMI < 18.5 (less than 18.5): **Underweight**
- 18.5 <= BMI < 25.0 (more than or equal to 18.5 and less than 25.0): **Normal**
- 25.0 <= BMI < 30.0 (more than or equal to 25.0 and less than 30.0): **Overweight**
- 30.0 <= BMI < 40.0 (more than or equal to 30.0 and less than 40.0): **Obese**
- BMI >= 40.0 (more than 40.0): **Severely Obese**

Expected Output:

### Health: Period

Tracks the start and end of user's menstrual cycle.

Format: <code style="color: #D85D43;">health /h:period /start:START_DATE [/end:END_DATE]</code>


* `START_DATE` is `DD-MM-YYYY` format (i.e. `19-03-2024`) representing the first day of period flow which is also the first day of the cycle. 

* `END_DATE` is `DD-MM-YYYY` format (i.e. `19-03-2024`) representing the last day of period flow. This parameter is **optional** and can be added once the period flow ends. To add an end date for a specific period, you need to input the correct corresponding start date.

> ⚠️ An outstanding period entry must have an end date specified before a new entry can be added.

Examples:

* <code style="color: #D85D43;">health /h:period /start:09-03-2022 /end:16-03-2022</code>
* <code style="color: #D85D43;">health /start:09-03-2022 /end:16-03-2022 /h:period</code>
* <code style="color: #D85D43;">health /h:period /start:09-03-2022</code>

### Health: Prediction

Predicts user's next period start date.

Format: <code style="color: #D85D43;">health /h:prediction</code>

* There must be at least **4 periods** added before a prediction can be made.

Expected Output:

![Viewing Prediction](img/output/viewing_prediction.png)

> ⚠️ PulsePilot **does not** impose minimum or maximum length requirements for menstrual cycles, as underlying medical conditions can cause variations in cycle lengths.
> 
> PulsePilot will only **notify** you if your cycle length is beyond the healthy range of **2 - 7 days**.

###### [Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

## Known Issues

### Colours Not Rendering

In some instances, the output from an error will result in odd characters being printed on screen:

![Colour not rendering](img/output/colour_not_rendered.png)

This color rendering issue is specific to Windows machines. The odd characters you see are actually escape sequences used to display color in the terminal. 

Windows 10 terminals do not have this color rendering feature enabled by default, whereas Windows 11 terminals do, hence displaying the colors correctly.

This is what the output is supposed to look like when the same command is used on a Windows 11 machine:

![Colour Rendered](img/output/correct_colour_render.png)

This is a visual bug, and it can be safely ignored by the user.

## FAQ

**1.** How do I transfer my data to another computer?

To transfer your data to another computer, make sure that `pulsepilot.jar` is placed in the **same folder** as `pulsepilot_data.txt` **and** `pulsepilot_hash.txt`. If done correctly, PulsePilot will recognize and synchronize your data.

> ⚠️ Create a _backup copy_ of both `pulsepilot_data.txt` and `pulsepilot_hash.txt` prior to file transfer to avoid data corruption.
>
> The _backup copies_ should be stored in a **separate** folder location from where the original `pulsepilot.jar` is saved.


**2.** What happens if my data is corrupted or tampered with?

> ❗ **_WARNING_: DO NOT** tamper with either `pulsepilot_data.txt` or `pulsepilot_hash.txt` to prevent **permanent** and **unrecoverable** loss of data.



You may experience 2 scenarios:

- A data file content corruption:

![Data Corruption](img/output/data_corruption.png)

Corruption of the `pulsepilot_data.txt` or `pulsepilot_hash.txt` files will result in **permanent and complete data loss**.

- A missing file error:

![Missing Files](img/output/missing_files.png)

A missing file error occurs when either `pulsepilot_data.txt` or `pulsepilot_hash.txt` is missing when PulsePilot is run. For safety and security reasons, PulsePilot will automatically delete any remaining data files before exiting the application.

**Both cases will inevitably result in permanent and complete data loss.**

> ❗ **DATA RECOVERY:** In both cases, you may want to recover data by utilising **both** your _backup_ copies of  `pulsepilot_data.txt` and `pulsepilot_hash.txt` to restore your data.

Otherwise, if you have lost your data, you can reinitialize a new save file by running the command `java -jar pulsepilot.jar` again.

**3.** Is my tracking data private and confidential?

Yes, your data is secure and stored locally on your machine. PulsePilot does not have any features that would allow it to send your data elsewhere.

**4.** What happens if I specify extra flags on accident?
   
Note that if you add duplicate or extra flags, the bot **will read the first instance only**.

**All other parameters will be ignored.**

For example:

```
workout /e:run /d:5.25 /t:59:50 /d:10.55
```

In the above output, the bot will read `5.25` as the distance. The second `/d:10.55` is ignored.

**5.** What if I keep receiving an error message even though my input seems to follow the instructions given in the user guide?

Please ensure that you follow the command syntax given **exactly** in the user guide. Some examples of mistakes that could be easily overlooked:

Example of the correct command:

![correct_command.png](img/correct_command.png)

- Error of adding extra space(s) in fixed parameters:
  - In this case, the altered fixed parameter is `/date:`, which was written as `/ date:` instead.

![extra_space_error_command.png](img/extra_space_error_command.png)

- Error of adding extra newline(s) after command:

![extra_newline_error_command.png](img/extra_newline_error_command.png)

Avoid using extra characters in the commands, such as blank space, newline, etc.

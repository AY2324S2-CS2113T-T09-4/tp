## Introduction

Hello! Thank you for choosing to use PulsePilot!

Our team appreciates that you are giving our health application a try, and we hope that it helps you document your recovery journey better and bounce back from whatever injury you are facing.

This document serves as the **User Guide** of PulsePilot, designed to help you (an injured athlete) learn what PulsePilot is about, our motives, how to install it and how to use it.

Learning to use software can be daunting. Thus, this guide was created for **non-technical users**, helping you unleash PulsePilot to its fullest potential!

Once again, we hope our application helps you, and thank you for choosing PulsePilot, and we hope you recover as fast as possible!

## How to use this guide

Before we delve into the content of what is PulsePilot and how to use it, we want to let you know and get familiar with the styling used in this guide, so that this guide can help you better!

### Glossary Usage

This guide may have difficult to understand technical jargon or terms used. Fret not! We understand that seeing such terms can be daunting to someone not familiar with it.

As such, our team has created a **Glossary** for you to refer to when reading this guide! It serves as a mini-dictionary, for you to read a definition and quickly go back to wherever you were.

Technical terms are marked in **italicised blue** [*like this*]()! When you click on it, it brings you to the glossary. Each term in the glossary also contains a 'Go back' button, and clicking on that returns you to where you originally were. This is to create a seamless reading experience for you! 

Note that only **the first instance** of a term will be hyperlinked!

Give it a try with the term: [*Object-Oriented Programming*](#glossary).

The blue phrases known are also known as [*hyperlinks*](#glossary).

Non-italicised hyperlinks [like this]() are used to bring you to different parts of the document.

For example, **the one below to bring you back to the table of contents on top!**

###### [Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

### Blocks

There are 3 different kinds of **blocks**, denoted using different **icons** to bring things to your attention.

> üí° This is an **information** block. It is used to highlight **additional** details that you might be interested in!

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is a **warning** block. It is used to highlight key information that **may** be useful for you!

> ‚ùó This is an **important** block. It contains information that you **MUST READ**! Take note of these!

## PulsePilot

### What is it?

PulsePilot is an application made by 6 computing students from the National University of Singapore (NUS) that helps you (the user) document each stage of your recovery journey better! More specifically, it was coded in [*Java*](#glossary).

The application is built for **both** healthcare professionals and patients. Using PulsePilot, patients can better record their recovery progress from an injury, as well as general well-being. 

Healthcare professionals on the other hand would use PulsePilot to view the information that a patient has logged, allowing them to better keep tabs on their patients' recovery status outside of the hospital.

At the time of writing, you can do the following with PulsePilot:

  - Keep training logs of **both run and gym** workouts.
- Store information of your **past menstrual cycles and make predictions of future cycles**.
- Record past or present **medical appointment** information.
- Keep a log of your **Body Mass Index (BMI)**.  

More details about how to [install](#installation) and use [PulsePilot](#pulsepilot-commands) are covered below!

###### [Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

### Origins

On top of being NUS Computing students, our team members are all competitive athletes who have had past injuries and hence dealt with the healthcare system in Singapore.

We came together and realised that one common denominator was our unhappiness with the level of service received from the healthcare system when we were injured. We want to use our experience and knowledge about creating software learned from our university course to better the lives of all athletes in Singapore.

We have done extensive research onto this problem, as well as received testimonials from both varsity and national-level athletes about their recovery experiences. In general, they too were unhappy with the level of service received.

The 2 main problems identified from our study were:

1. Poor communication between **healthcare professionals and patients** inhibiting medical progress:
 This can be caused by the long waiting periods in between sessions, by a patient seeing more than 1 specialist at a time or from the specialist having too many patients to monitor.

2. **Data Fragmentation**:
  As mentioned above, a patient can see many specialists, thus resulting in their information and hence recovery status being **spread out across different clinics, hospitals and people**. There is **no centralised system** for doctors to read patient data and for patients to update all doctors simultaneously.

The above problems gave rise to PulsePilot, the guide for which you are reading right now! PulsePilot was designed with both patients and healthcare professionals in mind to solve the 2 main problems identified above!

We hope that PulsePilot can bridge the information gap between you and your doctor, and we wish you a speedy recovery. :D

> ‚ùó This application is still in [*beta phase*](#glossary). As such it is not complete and more features will be added in future versions. Stay tuned for updates!

## Commands

### Workout: Run

Adds a new run workout to track.

Format: <code style="color: #D85D43;">workout /e:run /d:DISTANCE /t:TIME [/date:DATE]</code>

* `DISTANCE` is a **2 decimal point positive number** (i.e. `15.24`) representing the distance ran in **kilometers**.
* `TIME` is in `[HH]:MM:SS` format (i.e. `25:30`). The `HH` representing hours is **optional**.
* `DATE` is in `DD-MM-YYYY` format (i.e. `19-03-2024`). The date is **optional**, and if not specified, defaults to `NA`.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If `HH` is set to `00`, the bot will throw an error. Please use `MM:SS` if the `HH` field is not needed!


Examples:
- <code style="color: #D85D43;">workout /e:run /d:5.15 /t:25:03 /date:25-03-2023 </code>
- <code style="color: #D85D43;">workout /e:run /d:5.15 /t:25:03</code>

###### [Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

### Workout: Gym

Adds a new gym session to track.

Format: <code style="color: #D85D43;">workout /e:gym /n:NUMBER_OF_STATIONS [/date:DATE]</code>

* `NUMBER_OF_STATIONS` is a **positive integer of at least 1** representing the number of stations for one Gym session.
* `DATE` is in `DD-MM-YYYY` format (i.e. `19-03-2024`). The date is **optional**, and if not specified, defaults to `NA`.

Examples:

- <code style="color: #D85D43;">workout /e:gym /n:2 /date:25-03-2023</code>
- <code style="color: #D85D43;">workout /e:gym /n:4</code>

###### [Back to Experienced User Guide](#experienced-user-manual)

###### [Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

#### Adding Gym Stations

Upon entry of the `workout /e:gym` command, the bot will prompt for further details for each station done:

Format: <code style="color: #D85D43;">STATION_NAME /s:SET /r:REPS /w:WEIGHT</code>

* `STATION_NAME` is a **string**  representing the name of the gym station.
* `SET` is a **positive integer**  representing the number of sets done for one station.
* `REPS` is a **positive integer**  representing the number of repetitions done for one station.
* `WEIGHT` is a **list of positive numbers** separated by commas. It represents the weights used for all the sets in the station.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è `STATION_NAME` must always be the first parameter. The order of the other parameters can be in any order.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è `WEIGHT` must be in **multiples of 0.125 KG**. This is because the minimum weight increment in a gym is 0.125kg. Example `bench press /s:2 /r:10 /w:10.333,12.5` is not valid as 10.333 is not a multiple of 0.125kg.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note that the **number of weights must equal to the number of sets**! For example, if you have done 2 sets at 10 kg, PulsePilot still expects 2 weights to be specified like this `squats /s:2 /r:5 /w:10.25,10.5`.


Examples:
- <code style="color: #D85D43;">bench press /s:2 /r:4 /w:10,20</code>
- <code style="color: #D85D43;">squat /r:2 /s:2 /w:10.5,20.5</code>

Expected Output:

![Adding Gyms](../img/output/adding_gym.png)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Minimum inputs:**
Minimum weight: 0.00
Minimum number of sets: 1
Minimum number of repetitions: 1
> **Note that exceeding these bounds will trigger an error!**

Calculates user's Body Mass Index (BMI) based on height and weight from user's input.

Format: <code style="color: #D85D43;">health /h:bmi /height:HEIGHT /weight:WEIGHT /date:DATE</code>

* Parameters after `health` can be in any order.
* `HEIGHT` is a **2 decimal point number in metres** (i.e. `1.71`) representing the user's height.
* `WEIGHT` is a **2 decimal point number in kilograms** (i.e. `60.50`) representing the user‚Äôs weight.
* `DATE` is in `DD-MM-YYYY` format (i.e. `19-03-2024`).

Examples:
* <code style="color: #D85D43;">health /h:bmi /height:1.70 /weight:75.42 /date:19-03-2024</code>
* <code style="color: #D85D43;">health /h:bmi /date:19-03-2024 /height:1.70 /weight:75.42</code>

Expected Output:

![Adding BMI](../img/output/adding_bmi.png)

The ranges for BMI are as follows:

- BMI < 18.5 (less than 18.5): **Underweight**
- 18.5 <= BMI < 25.0 (more than or equal to 18.5 and less than 25.0): **Normal**
- 25.0 <= BMI < 30.0 (more than or equal to 25.0 and less than 30.0): **Overweight**
- 30.0 <= BMI < 40.0 (more than or equal to 30.0 and less than 40.0): **Obese**
- BMI >= 40.0 (more than 40.0): **Severely Obese**

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Minimum and Maximum inputs:**
> Maximum Height: 2.75, Minimum Height: 0.01

### Health: Period

Tracks the start and end of user's menstrual cycle.


Format: <code style="color: #D85D43;">health /h:period /start:START_DATE [/end:END_DATE]</code>

* Parameters after `health` can be in any order.

* `START_DATE` is `DD-MM-YYYY` format (i.e. `19-03-2024`) representing the first day of period flow which is also the first day of the cycle. This parameter needs to be present at all times (i.e. inputting a new period input or adding in end date).

* `END_DATE` is `DD-MM-YYYY` format (i.e. `19-03-2024`) representing the last day of period flow. This parameter is optional and can be input once the period flow ends. To add an end date, you need to input the correct corresponding start date of the period.

**Warning:** Every period input needs to include a start date and end date before adding a new period input.


Examples:
* <code style="color: #D85D43;">health /h:period /start:09-03-2022 /end:16-03-2022</code>
* <code style="color: #D85D43;">health /start:09-03-2022 /end:16-03-2022 /h:period</code>
* * <code style="color: #D85D43;">health /h:period /start:09-03-2022</code>


Expected Output:

![Adding Periods](../img/output/adding_period.png)

### Health: Prediction

Predicts user's next period start date.

Format: <code style="color: #D85D43;">health /h:prediction</code>

* All parameters must be provided in the correct order.
* There must be at least **4 periods** added before a prediction can be made.

Expected Output:

![Viewing Prediction](../img/output/viewing_prediction.png)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **There is no minimum and maximum cycle lengths** for a period and hence cycle, since underlying medical conditions can cause varying cycle lengths.
> PulsePilot will only **notify** you if your cycle length is outside of the healthy range of **2 - 7 days**.
